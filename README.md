#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var: Can be re-assigned and redeclared.
let: Can be re-assigned, but not redeclared within the same scope.
const: Cannot be reassigned or redeclared.



#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

forEach() does not return anything; it’s for doing something with each element, not transforming the array.
map() does not change the original array, but returns a new transformed array.
filter() creates a subset of the original array.


#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions introduced in ES6. They are often shorter and behave slightly differently than traditional functions, especially with this.



#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring assignment in ES6 is a concise way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables. Instead of accessing each element or property individually, you can “unpack” them in a single statement.


#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals are a new way to work with strings in ES6. They make string creation more readable and powerful than traditional string concatenation.
